Clipboard
=========

Integrates zsh clipboard with system clipboard.

On OSX, uses pbcopy and pbpaste. On cygwin, uses /dev/clipboard. On linux, requires either xclip or xsel be installed.

## Notes

This currently only works with vi key bindings. PRs to add support for emacs based keybinds would be welcome.
